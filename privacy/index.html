    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>MugBee &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>
  </header>

  <p>MugBee ("we", "our", or "the app") is a personal ceramic and tea-ware journaling app. This policy explains what data the app handles and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>MugBee stores the following data that you create:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Item records</strong> — names, categories, maker/artist info, materials, purchase price, and notes for each ceramic piece you add.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos</strong> — photos you take or import from your photo library to document your pieces.</li>
    <li><strong>Activity logs</strong> — dates, brew parameters (temperature, ratio, time, etc.), mood, and personal notes for each activity you record.</li>
    <li><strong>Groups and metadata</strong> — any custom groupings, tags, or metadata you create within the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect analytics, crash reports, advertising identifiers, or any data beyond what you explicitly enter into the app.</p>

  <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>All data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Apple's SwiftData framework.</p>
  <p>If you enable iCloud Sync in Settings, your data (including photos) is additionally stored in your personal iCloud account via Apple's CloudKit service. This sync is entirely under your Apple ID and governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We never have access to your iCloud data.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third party. MugBee contains no third-party SDKs, no advertising networks, and no analytics services.</p>

  <h2>4. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
  <p>MugBee requests access to your camera and photo library solely to let you photograph and import images of your ceramic pieces. Photos are stored only on your device (and optionally in your iCloud account if sync is enabled). We do not upload photos to any external server.</p>

  <h2>5. Deleting Your Data</h2>
  <p>You can delete individual items, activities, or groups directly within the app. To remove all data, go to <strong>Settings → Delete All Data</strong>. If iCloud Sync is enabled, deleting data in the app will also remove it from CloudKit.</p>
  <p>Uninstalling the app removes all local data from your device. iCloud data can be managed separately through iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>MugBee does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app is rated 4+ and contains no features directed at children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mugbee.app">support@mugbee.app</a>.</p>
